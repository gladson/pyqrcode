Rendering QR Codes
******************

There are three possible formats for rendering the QR Code. The first is
to render it as a string of 1's and 0's. There are also two image based
renderers. Both allow you to set the colors used. They also take a scaling
factor, that way each module is not rendered as 1 pixel.

Text Rendering
==============

The pyqrcode module includes a text renderer. This will return a string
containing the QR code as a string of 1's and 0's, with each row of the code on
a new line. A :term:`data module` in the QR Code is represented by a 1.
Likewise, 0 is used to represent the background of the code.

The purpose of this renderer is to allow users to create their own renderer if
neither the svg or png renderers are satisfactory.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> number = pyqrcode.create(123)
  >>> print(number.text())
  00000000000000000000000
  01111111001101011111110

Image Rendering
===============

There are two ways to get an image of the generated QR code. Both renderers 
have a few things in common.

Both renderers take a file path or writable file stream and draw the QR
code there. The methods should auto-detect which is which.

Each renderer takes a scale parameter. This parameter sets the size of a single
:term:`data module` in pixels. Setting this parameter to one, will
result in each :term:`data module` taking up 1 pixel. In other words, the QR
code would be too small to scan. What scale to use depends on how you plan to
use the QR code. Generally, three, four, or five will result in small but
scanable QR codes.

Both renderers, also, allow you to set the :term:`module` and background colors.
Although, how the colors are represented are renderer specific.

Scalable Vector Graphic
-----------------------

The SVG renderer outputs the QR code as a scalable vector graphic using
the :py:meth:`pyqrcode.QRCode.svg` method. *This
renderer does not require any external modules.*

The method draws the QR code using a set of horizontal lines. By default, no
background is drawn, i.e. the resulting code has a transparent background. The
default foreground color is black.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> url = pyqrcode.create('http://uca.edu')
  >>> url.svg(sys.stdout, scale=1)
  >>> url.svg('uca.svg', scale=4)
  
You can change the colors of the data-modules using the *module_color*
parameter. Likewise, you can specify a background using the *background*
parameter. Each of these parameters take a HTML style color.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> url.svg('uca.svg', scale=4, background="white", module_color="#7D007D")

Portable Network Graphic
------------------------

The PNG renderer ouputs the QR code as a portable network graphic file using
the :py:meth:`pyqrcode.QRCode.png` method.

.. note::

  This renderer requires the `pypng <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypng/>`_
  module.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> url = pyqrcode.create('http://uca.edu')
  >>> with open('code.png', 'w') as fstream:
  ...     url.png(fstream, scale=5)


Colors should be a list or tuple containing numbers between zero an 255. The
lists should be of length three (for RGB) or four (for RGBA). The color (0,0,0)
represents black and the color (255,255,255) represents white. A value of zero
for the fourth element, represents full transparency. Likewise, a value of 255
for the fourth element represents full opacity.

By default, the renderer creates a QR code with the data modules colored
black, and the background modules colored white.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> url.png('uca-colors.png', scale=6, module_color=[0, 0, 0, 128], background=[0xff, 0xff, 0xcc])
